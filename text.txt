About me

Audrey Hepburn was a British actress, model, dancer, and humanitarian. Recognised as a film and fashion icon. She was ranked by the American Film Institute as the third-greatest female screen legend in Golden Age Hollywood, and was inducted into the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame.

My greatest ambition is to have a career without becoming a career woman.
